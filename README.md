# COMP397-Lesson3
Made via using Lesson 2 as a VS Template - This lesson helps in understanding for COMP397 Assignment - The Dragon

This repo covers the process of the Lesson 3 in which we make a state machine.

This README reminds me how to "Pull" from GitHub on the Team Explorer for Visual Studio (in Unsynced Commits), 
which basically syncs commits from GitHub (this README commits to master branch) to the local repository 
(in order to have README in my Lesson 3 files on my computer).
